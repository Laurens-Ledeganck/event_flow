,,,,,,,,,,Conclusions from first batch: 
,,,,,,,,,,4 runs took between 1 and 3 days for 100 epochs
,,,,,,,,,,"I already have a bunch of pre-trained networks, so let's compare the performance"
,,,,,,,,,,I should also make a better overview of the different models and their differences
,,,,,,,,,,"For future pre-training tests: reduce n_epochs to 20, after this performance gains are minimal"
,,,,,,,,,,"Regarding the time-issue: first hypothesis: too many events, but I tested and event windows up to 100000 work fine; second hypothesis: something is being stored in CUDA for every window, there is too many of these which causes the memoryerror, first guess is that it's the loss but that's summed so is not a list, also the number of rows for each failure is very different, also losses are not logged because it doesn't complete a full epoch, a further investigation of the memory shows that in event mode only ~1000 MB of data are stored, compared to 20000 for time-based: the cache memory keeps increasing, deleting this every once in a while might help?, using time steps of 0.0001 also fails -> conclusion: something is drastically increasing the memory usage in time mode and I don't know what"
